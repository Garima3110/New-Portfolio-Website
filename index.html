            <u><h1>ABOUT</h1></u>
            <p id="description" class="faded">Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Garima, a 19-year-old Computer Science and Engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology in Patiala, Punjab. Currently, I'm in my second year of studies, where I've been building a strong foundation in programming and web development. I possess a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing primarily on frontend development. However, I am currently in the process of expanding my skills to include backend web development, with a keen interest in learning Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. <br>

                In addition to my web development expertise, I am well-versed in programming languages such as C, C++, and have a solid understanding of the basics of Java. I'm also proficient in using Canva, allowing me to create visually appealing designs for various projects. <br>
                
                As an enthusiastic learner, I am always eager to explore new technologies and frameworks. I have a particular interest in diving into the world of Three.js and other frameworks in the near future. I believe in the power of continuous learning, embracing challenges, and learning from my mistakes. <br>
                
                I invite you to explore my portfolio and witness my journey as I grow and expand my skills in the field of development and coding. Feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries or opportunities. Thank you for visiting!
